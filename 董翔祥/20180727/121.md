Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e.,  buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find  the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

其实就是个求最大差值的题，10秒不用

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for(int day = 0;day<prices.length-1;day++) {
        	for(int resday = day+1;resday<prices.length;resday++) {
        		int profit = prices[resday]-prices[day];
        		if(profit>maxprofit) {
        			maxprofit = profit;
        		}
        	}
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```
