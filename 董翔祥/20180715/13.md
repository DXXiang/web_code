Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`.  Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same  principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.



罗马数字转换的问题，知道规则就挺简单的，左加右减

```java
class Solution {
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        Map<Character,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    	map.put('I', 1);
    	map.put('V', 5);
    	map.put('X', 10);
    	map.put('L', 50);
    	map.put('C', 100);
    	map.put('D', 500);
    	map.put('M', 1000);
    	
        char[] str = s.toCharArray();
        int result=0;
        int last = 0;
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = str.length-1;i>=0;i--) {
        	index = map.get(str[i]);
        	if(last<=index) {	//	左边大于等于右边就加
        		result += index;     		
        	}else {					//右边大于左边就减
        		result -= index;
        	}
        	last = index;
        	
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
