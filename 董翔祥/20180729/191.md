# 191

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011 
```

很久没碰位运算了

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n!=0) {
        	count+=n&1;
        	n>>>=1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
