# 278

You  are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new  product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the  quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous  version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

------
要求是尽可能少调用那个判断方法，这就有点摸不着了，查了下，用二分查找，自己想了下的确，二分查找不需要全都遍历判断，可以减少调用

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        int ver = 0;
        while (low < high) {
            ver = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(ver)) {
                high = ver;
            } else {
                low = ver + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
}
```
